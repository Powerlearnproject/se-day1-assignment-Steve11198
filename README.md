Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
- It enables the creation of applications and systems that power every day life including communication, eccommerce and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. development of programming language example fortran and C.
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and the user interface.
3. Implementation: This is writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and it's functional.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison:
- Agile is flexible; Waterfall is predictable but inflexible.
- Agile allows continuous feedback; Waterfall involves customers mainly at the start and end.
- Waterfall requires extensive documentation; Agile prioritizes working software.

Contrast:
- Waterfall is riskier if changes are needed later; Agile reduces risk by allowing changes throughout.
- Agile can deliver faster; Waterfall requires completion of all phases before delivery.

  Examples:
- Agile is used in developing mobile apps, it allows teams to iterate quickly, incorporate user feedback, and release updates frequently.
- Waterfall is used in building a hospital where a phase has to be completed before moving to the next one.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) these are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Visual Studio.
- Version Control Systems (VCS) these are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common Challenges:
a. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
b. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
c. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges:
- effective communication
-  agile methodologies
-  prioritization of tasks
-  regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

 - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

- Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
- Prompt engineering helps avoid asking vague questions and getting confusing answers from AI by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- 'Tell me about cats'
- Improved prompt, 'Tell me the history of domestic cats'. The second prompt is more specific and clear as compared to the first one.
